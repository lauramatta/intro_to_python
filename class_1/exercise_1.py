#Exercise 1 - Calculate months and days from year different

purchase_year = 2012
current_year = 2021

number_months = (current_year - purchase_year) * 12
number_days = (current_year - purchase_year) * 365

print("number of months since purchase" + str(number_months))
print("number of days since purchase" + str(number_days))
